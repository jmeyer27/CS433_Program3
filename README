Completing this project will require writing the following CPP files:

schedule_fcfs.cpp (needs help w/ order) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_sjf.cpp (everything needs time settings too) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order and add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_priority.cpp (needs help w/ order) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_priority_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order && add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.


TODO:
1. fix out of order issue, either change List from a stack to a linked list or in each add() make changes?
2. time settings thing that is required (Turnaround time, wait time)
3. comments. So many comments.
