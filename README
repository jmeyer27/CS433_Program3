Completing this project will require writing the following CPP files:

schedule_fcfs.cpp (complete)
schedule_sjf.cpp (complete)
schedule_rr.cpp (add rr number thing) 
schedule_priority.cpp (complete)
schedule_priority_rr.cpp (add rr number thing)(turnaround/wait time)

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.


TODO:
1. Time settings thing that is required (Turnaround time, wait time)
2. Comments. So many comments.
3. The RR and PriorityRR extra parameter thing
