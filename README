Completing this project will require writing the following CPP files:

schedule_fcfs.cpp (needs help w/ order)
schedule_sjf.cpp (everything needs time settings too)
schedule_rr.cpp
schedule_priority.cpp
schedule_priority_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order && add rr number thing)

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.
