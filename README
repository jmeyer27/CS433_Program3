Completing this project will require writing the following CPP files:

schedule_fcfs.cpp (needs help w/ order) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_sjf.cpp (everything needs time settings too) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order and add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_priority.cpp (currently has segmentation fault. Something is very wrong.)
schedule_priority_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order && add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.


TODO:
schedule_priority (currently has segmentation fault. Something is very wrong.)
fix order issue, either change from stack to linked list or in each add() make changes?
time settings thing
comments. So many comments.
