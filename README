Completing this project will require writing the following CPP files:

schedule_fcfs.cpp 
schedule_sjf.cpp 
schedule_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order and add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)
schedule_priority.cpp 
schedule_priority_rr.cpp (needs help w/ order && add rr number thing) but works PERFECT :)

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.


TODO:
1. Time settings thing that is required (Turnaround time, wait time)
2. Comments. So many comments.
3. The RR and PriorityRR extra parameter thing
